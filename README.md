# Labkit

An advanced ImageJ2 plug in for image labeling and segmentation.

## Installation and Usage

See https://imagej.net/Labkit

## Extend Labkit

### Customize the Segmentation Algorithm

It you developed a segmentation algorithm, but you don't want to develope your own GUI. You might just use the Labkit GUI, see:
